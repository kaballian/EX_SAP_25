\section{Current Technology and Service Landscape}
As a result of the merger between Mediscan Aps and HealthSync Mobile Aps, the it environment, inherited to LHT, 
is comprised to two very different digital landscapes. These difference goes beyond mere technocal platforms, 
such as tool chosen for various tasks, but also divering filosophies. This leaves LHT to operation in a Hybrid environment,
where some parts of the company use incompatible identity systems, inconsistent governance practices and service providers
that might not be a perfect fit for EU regulations. 

\subsection{Mediscan technology landscape }
Mediscan originates from traditional engineering practies, around product development, production, calibration and
quality asurance. These include
\begin{itemize}
    \item On-prem EU-local infrastructre, there the whole it system is segmented into various sub networks, for engineering, 
    manufacturing and servers. 
    \item Local AD controllers, running on older operating systems, with weak overall governance
    \item weak network security regarding hardware, older switches with no updates
    \item no MFA and relying on password update rotations
\end{itemize}

The infrastructre inherited from Mediscan, shows strong prefence to local storage and authentication along with a 
typical product first approach, where cynersecurity is seen as a hinderance.
