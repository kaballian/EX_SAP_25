\section{Executive Summary}
The purpose of this report is the examine, expand and define the organizations current 
dependancy on non-EU technology, evaluate the key risks associated with this direction, analyse
and propose EU alternatives. The goal is to identify and map a road to digital Sovereignty.

The current political climate is quite inhospitable and it has become apparent that 
world leaders make drastic, snap decisions that brings large implication to 
the technological landscape, where big tech can be leveraged as political
thus inherently changing the risk of reliance on such servies. Thus companies, with suchs 
reliances, risks getting caught in the crossfire.  

Services where there is a heavy reliance, from companies such a \textit{Microsoft}, 
which hosts Azure \text{Active directory (AD)}, used for identity management and \textit{SharePoint} and \textit{OneDrive}, 
which Lifeline Health Technologies(LHT) uses as a file sharing service, could suddenly
become unavailable. 

A loss of this service, which would be tantamount to loss of many years of technological IPs 
and achievements which could lead to unquantifiable damage to the company. 
Thus, in this inclimate weather, a EU alternative for these servises, is quintessential. % for a cloud based
%backup plan, along with a, yet to be implemented, physical backup. 

The main findings of this report is an overreliance on
\begin{itemize}
    \item Microsoft Azure Services, where cloud hosting is indeterminate and 
    jurisdictional expose is somewhat vague. Thus EU laws may be hard to apply
    \item process and regulatory mismatches - Data is easily given up to 3rd party cloud services 
    without regard for compliance (EU MDR)
    \item A thorough documentation is needed of other cloud solutions, specifically regarding SaaS tools
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
    \item main risks
\end{itemize}


Examples for some EU-alternatives :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Univention - German based software for identity \& access management. A self hosted AD, requiring a virtual machine. 
    Can then handle all authentication, along with other features such as single sign-on(SSO) and multifactor authentication (MFA)
    \item Scaleway - A cloud hosting service, to host VM's for infrastructre purposes.
\end{itemize}

Thus Univention can be hosted by Scaleway, thus removing the dependancy on a Microsoft service.  

In addition, the company's productivity suite, can be replaced by libre-office
