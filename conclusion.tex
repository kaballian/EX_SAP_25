\section{Conclusion}
If this change in infrastructre is implemented, it would increase the digital 
sovereignty of the company and decrease its reliance on American services. 
In the risk analysis, it became apparent that both companies of this merger, 
were stuck in two different infrastructe and culture ideologies. Mediscan, being
a product development company, with firm roots in engineering practicies and bandaid 
solutions and HealthSync Mobile, a more contemporary company, whose development pratices
better reflect, the modern environment of cloud companies.\\
To intertwine the two companies and their ecosystems, with impunity, taking their
current infrastructures into account, seems almost like wishful thinking.
With the current geopolitical situation, a completly new and revised structure of 
the entire IT system is preferable. The transition should preferably be gradual, both to support
cultural changes, for both agile developers and seasoned engineers, along with strong 
customer support to guide them through the transition, should any unforseen circumstances
arise.
