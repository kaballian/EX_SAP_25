\section{Comparison of current and proposed solutions}
The Suitablility of these EU derived alternatives will here be evaulated against the already 
implemented solution, in terms of technical compatability, which reflects how well this
solution fits into the current LHT environment.\\ 

Technical compatability assesses the difficulty of implementing the proposed solutions,
into the environment of LHT. Replacing all Azure services and with suitable replacements,
which offers equivalent services, in this case Univention for identity management and Scaleway
for hosting for cloud computte and storage, reduces the implementation effort, thus increases the chance 
of a smooth migration\\

Examples of this is the Active directory from Univention, which replaces Azure AD, with minimal
changes to already implemented authentication dependencies. Univention also provides
NUBUS with keyCloak, which preserves the use of OAuth2 and OpenID for
customer usageage. While changing the underlying structure to a self-hosted environment,
located in the EU.\\

Distributing the services across a number of different EU providers, increases the 
flexibility and should reduce the long term vendor lock-in. An example of this
is ScaleWay, which can do both cloud compute, data storage and processing.
But also host a GIT server and other required developer tooling, but with smaller
requirements for future changes.
